# Revisit an earlier homework 

Revisit a previous homework you have done from weeks 3 or 4. I have included all their project files in this repo under `projects/`. Do this homework again, from scratch. You can look at your earlier work if you have to, but do not cut and paste it. Try to use classes and objects and test your code.

No `package.json` or `.gitignore` is provided. You must create these yourself.
