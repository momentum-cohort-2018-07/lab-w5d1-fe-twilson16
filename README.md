# Note-Taking App

## Directions

In today's project, you will use Ajax to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, making a one-page application in the process.

Your application is a note-taking app. It should display a list of all your notes and give you the ability to create new notes, edit old notes, and delete notes. Notes are made up of a title, text, optional tags, and the date/time most recently updated.

No wireframe is provided. You will have to create a design yourself. Looking at Google Keep may provide some inspiration.

The API you will use to retrieve and store your notes is https://notes-api.glitch.me/. This API was created for this assignment. If you encounter any errors with it, contact Clinton.

## Bonus steps

Make tags on notes clickable and update the page to only show notes with that tag. If you implement this, you'll need to indicate you're looking at a view of only that tag and have a way to get back to the full list.
